# Anchor Password Manager
Firstly, ensure that you are running Python 3.10.0, to check your Python version open command prompt and run the command ```python --version```. 

After verifying that you have Python 3.10.0 installed please make sure you have all the neccessary packages, you can find the neccessary packages in the ```requirements.txt``` file. To download all packages simultaneously open command prompt and run the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Please keep in mind that Anchor was made as a simple side project in my free time. While it does protect your passwords to an extent it was NOT made to contend with mainstream password managers such as Bitwarden and Lastpass. For something easy to use and setup this is a decent alternative to both.

A few planned updates if I feel like it, such as an optional added layer of security, more details if I decide to implement it.

Sorry for the lack of color, like I said it was just something simple I worked on in my free time though.

**PSA: DO NOT SHARE YOUR SECRET KEY WITH ANYONE**

EXE this time, sorry!!! (Next upload will most likely be open src to compensate)
